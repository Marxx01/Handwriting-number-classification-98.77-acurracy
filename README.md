# Handwriting-number-classification-98.77-acurracy
This handwriting number classification model, implemented in PyTorch, achieves 98.77% accuracy. It is trained on the MNIST dataset from Hugging Face using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.

# Project Structure

1- Training.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.

2- Implement.py: This Python file contains an interface where you can draw a number, and the program will return the number it believes you are drawing.
